# Bombparty
Python bot to play bombparty

## How to use it

### Import modules
First, install the necessary modules with the command : pip install -r requirements.txt

### Load the dictionnary
Make sure you have downloaded every file into the same folder. Then run the file load_dictionary.py. It will create a clean dictionnary (i.e., without accents or "-") that the script will use for the game.

### Calibration
For your first game only. Split your screen into two windows, one with the Bombparty game, the other with the script calibration.py. Launch the script and follow the instructions. 

### Play
Launch the find_dico.py file. Press Enter when you are ready. Enjoy !

# Disclaimer
I did not create this program to cheat; I did it because I enjoy coding. I recommand you not to abuse it and use it only against bots or friends.

# Support
My script is far from being perfect. Therefore, if you have any recommendations to improve it, do not hesitate. 

Thank you,
The Spicy
